# Memo Game

A fun and interactive memory game built using C# and WPF, where players match word pairs in English and Polish. Perfect for language learning or simply sharpening your memory skills!

## Features
- A 4x4 grid of buttons that hide word pairs.
- Matches words in English and their Polish equivalents (e.g., "Dog" and "Pies").
- Highlights correct pairs with unique colors.
- Tracks elapsed time during gameplay.
- Displays a "Congratulations" message when all pairs are found.

## How to Play
1. Click the **Start Game** button to initialize the grid.
2. Click on two buttons to reveal their hidden words.
3. If the words form a correct pair, the buttons will remain revealed and disabled.
4. If the pair is incorrect, the buttons will hide their words after a brief delay.
5. Continue until all pairs are matched!

## How It Works
- Words are randomly assigned to buttons at the start of the game.
- Correct pairs are highlighted with specific colors defined for each word.
- The game ends when all word pairs are matched.
